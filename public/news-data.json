        "content": "The alleged ultimatum from President Trump to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, demanding his immediate resignation, highlights a troubling pattern of US interventionism in sovereign nations. This coercive tactic risks escalating tensions and destabilizing an already fragile region, rather than promoting genuine democratic solutions. The White House's ongoing discussions with advisors about political and military options signal a dangerous path toward undermining international law and the self-determination of the Venezuelan people, masking systemic issues with a strongman approach.",

This follow-up strike, part of an operation now facing increased public scrutiny, underscores a problematic pattern where justifications for aggressive maneuvers are often vague and accountability appears elusive. Such incidents demand rigorous oversight and public discourse, especially when they risk international incidents and obscure the systemic drivers of drug trafficking.",
