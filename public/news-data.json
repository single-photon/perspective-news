While a suspect, identified as an Afghan national, has been apprehended, the swift response from President Trump's administration to order a review of all Afghan nationals admitted to the country raises serious concerns about potential xenophobic policies. The deployment of an additional 500 Guard troops to the capital also prompts questions about the militarization of public spaces and the administration's approach to domestic security.",
