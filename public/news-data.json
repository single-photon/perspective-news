This hushed conversation raises questions about executive oversight, especially given the White House's swift defense of a subsequent strike on what it termed an 'alleged drug vessel,' claiming self-defense. Critics argue that such private briefings, coupled with a lack of detailed public accountability, allow for potentially unchecked military actions that demand greater scrutiny and a focus on de-escalation rather than unilateral force.",
