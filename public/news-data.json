        "content": "Following a tragic shooting near the White House where two West Virginia National Guard members were critically wounded, the Trump administration responded with a sweeping and discriminatory policy change. Identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the suspect's actions were met with the deployment of 500 additional Guard troops and, more concerningly, an indefinite pause on immigration processing for all Afghans. This broad-brush response reflects a systemic issue of xenophobia, punishing an entire community for the alleged actions of one individual and fueling dangerous anti-immigrant sentiment.",
