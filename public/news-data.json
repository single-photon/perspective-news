These comments are not isolated incidents but reflect a broader strategy to demonize marginalized groups, fanning the flames of division and hatred. Such rhetoric from the highest office normalizes prejudice and poses a grave threat to the safety and dignity of all immigrant communities, demanding a unified stand against hate speech and for inclusive policies.",
