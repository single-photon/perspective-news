The powerful tremor, described as \"quite a jiggle\" by one particularly stoic trapper, managed to achieve the impressive feat of causing precisely zero injuries or structural damage. Experts speculate the earthquake, after all its hard work, was deeply disappointed to learn that its dramatic performance had no audience beyond a few bewildered marmots. The U.S. Tsunami Warning System, ever vigilant, confirmed that the West Coast was safe from any potential tidal waves of \"mild concern.\"",
