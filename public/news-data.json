Sources close to the committee (read: \"anyone with a Twitter account\") suggest the decision-making process involved a complex algorithm factoring in everything from strength of schedule to the aesthetic appeal of team uniforms, culminating in a dramatic \"rock-paper-scissors\" tie-breaker. Fans across the nation are currently engaged in the sacred autumnal ritual of proclaiming the entire system rigged, with Notre Dame supporters already filing formal complaints to the Hague and threatening to boycott all future televised sporting events, except for their own.",
