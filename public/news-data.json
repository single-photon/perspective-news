        "content": "President Trump has controversially announced that the U.S. will permit Nvidia to sell its most advanced AI chips to China, a move widely perceived as prioritizing corporate profits over national security or human rights concerns. This decision, which reportedly includes a significant 25% U.S. share of the sales, relaxes crucial export controls on high-end technology. Critics argue this move signals a dangerous willingness to enable authoritarian regimes for financial gain, overlooking the potential for advanced AI to be used in surveillance or other problematic ways, further entrenching global power imbalances.",
