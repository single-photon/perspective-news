This unexpected outcome serves as a significant check on attempts to manipulate electoral maps for partisan gain, directly challenging President Trump's public opposition to the rejection. President Trump had previously threatened to back a primary challenger against the state's GOP Senate leader in response to this vote, highlighting the intense pressure applied to maintain systemic power imbalances through gerrymandering.

But then, some other Republicans, along with Democrats, said 'no' to the plan. This was a big deal because President Trump really wanted the plan to pass, and he got upset when it didn't. He even said he might try to get new leaders in charge because of it.",
