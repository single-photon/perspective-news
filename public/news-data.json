Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, alongside Jared Kushner, had arrived for five hours of intense discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Yet, in its immense power, a strange mercy was found. The epicenter's isolation, far from bustling towns and cities, softened its destructive potential. Houses didn't crumble, lives weren't instantly imperiled. The ground moved, mountains groaned, and the vast, uninhabited landscape absorbed the colossal tremor, a testament to nature's might, largely unseen, unfelt by human hand.",
