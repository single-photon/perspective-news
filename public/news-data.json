Critics argue these operations often lack transparency and accountability, leading to unnecessary loss of life and exacerbating systemic issues rather than solving them. This incident underscores the urgent need for a thorough reevaluation of militarized approaches to drug control and greater oversight to prevent further tragedies and ensure justice for victims.",
