Greene detailed how these same lawmakers only outwardly \"kissed his a**\" once his primary win was secured, driven by fear of his retribution and social media attacks. This revelation highlights a systemic issue where political loyalty is dictated by personal gain and fear of reprisal, rather than genuine conviction or public service.",
