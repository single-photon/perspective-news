The 33-page document replaces any pretense of democracy promotion with a purely transactional approach, explicitly prioritizing corporate profit and an outdated concept of regional dominance in the Western Hemisphere. By reviving a modernized Monroe Doctrine, it signals a return to imperialistic tendencies, while its dismissal of collective defense obligations sparks significant concern among international allies and undermines global stability.",
