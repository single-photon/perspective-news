Prosecutors allege Moore, in a move widely praised by cinematic drama enthusiasts, 'barged into his ex-partner's home,' where he then 'grabbed knives and scissors' - presumably for a craft project gone horribly wrong - and proceeded to threaten self-harm. Authorities characterized this behavior as 'terrorizing,' though sources close to Moore insist he was merely attempting to stage a performance art piece about the fragility of the male ego.",

Johnson's grip on the gavel has become so tenuous, observers report it's now more of a light caress, as rank-and-file GOP members repeatedly defy his leadership with the cunning of a thousand wolverines. Employing arcane procedural tactics like 'discharge petitions' - rumored to involve ancient scrolls and a secret handshake - these rebellious Republicans successfully bypassed their leader on critical issues, including a bill related to the Epstein materials and, most hilariously, overturning an executive order issued by President Trump. Johnson's aides insist he's merely giving them 'more autonomy,' which translates to 'they do whatever they want.'",
