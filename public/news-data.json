This challenge to the \"for-cause\" removal clause, a crucial check on arbitrary executive power, threatens to politicize vital institutions like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), potentially allowing President Trump to fire commissioners without just cause.

This bold approach, which saw clemency extended to luminaries like a former Honduran president, completely redefines 'contradiction' in the political lexicon. Critics, clearly missing the nuance, claimed this was somehow at odds with his fierce anti-drug rhetoric and highly publicized military operations against suspected traffickers. President Trump's administration, however, insists these pardons are merely part of a sophisticated, multi-pronged approach to drug enforcement that ensures *some* people stay in jail.",
