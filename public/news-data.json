        "content": "Imagine if the President could just fire anyone he wanted who works for the government, even people in special groups that are supposed to be kind of on their own. The Supreme Court, which is like the highest judge group, is looking at a really old rule from 90 years ago that says the President can't just fire these people whenever. This new case, called *Trump v. Slaughter*, might change that. If the President gets to fire more people, it means he could have a lot more power over how the government works. Some people think this is part of a plan called 'Project 2025' to give the President more control.",
