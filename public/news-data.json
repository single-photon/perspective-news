        "content": "The White House has confirmed a contentious second military strike against a suspected Venezuelan drug boat in early September, igniting significant scrutiny over the administration's adherence to international law and its evolving narrative. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's assertion that the commander acted \"well within his authority and the law\" fails to address the deeper systemic questions surrounding military overreach and the potential for destabilizing regional conflicts under the guise of the failed 'war on drugs' strategy. This incident further illustrates the need for greater transparency and accountability in foreign military operations.",
