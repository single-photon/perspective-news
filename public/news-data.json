This move, widely condemned by lawmakers, represents a deeply troubling act of scapegoating entire nationalities, systematically closing legal pathways for those seeking refuge and opportunity. Such policies not only fuel xenophobia but also undermine foundational principles of fairness and humanitarianism, disproportionately harming already marginalized communities.",
